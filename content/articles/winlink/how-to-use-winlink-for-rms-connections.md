# How to Use Winlink for RMS Connections
In the previous articles, I introduced you to Winlink, a global radio email system that allows users to exchange messages with attachments, position reports, weather bulletins, emergency and relief communications, and more. I also explored the benefits of using Winlink for radio email communication, especially in situations where the internet is not available or reliable.

In this article, I will provide a step-by-step guide on how to use Winlink Express, the most popular client software for Winlink, to connect to the Winlink Hybrid Network via radio message servers (RMS). I will cover the system requirements, the installation and configuration process, the supported modes and frequencies, and the basic operations of sending and receiving messages.

## What are the system requirements?
To use Winlink Express, you will need the following:

- A computer running Windows 7 or later, with at least 1 GB of RAM and 100 MB of free disk space.
- A valid amateur radio license, or a license or authorization from a participating government service or agency.
- A radio transceiver capable of operating on the desired mode and frequency, such as HF, VHF, UHF, or satellite.
- An interface device that connects your radio to your computerâ€™s sound card or USB port, such as the Signalink, the Rigblaster, or the built-in sound card interface of some radios. This device will handle the audio signals and the push-to-talk function for your radio.
- A virtual TNC software that communicates with your interface device and Winlink Express, such as SoundModem by UZ7HO, Direwolf, or the built-in Winmor TNC of Winlink Express. This software will handle the data conversion and packet creation for Winlink.
- An internet connection for downloading and updating Winlink Express, and for accessing the Winlink Web Services. You do not need an internet connection for sending and receiving messages via radio.

## How to install and configure Winlink Express?
To install and configure Winlink Express, you will need to follow these steps:

- Download the latest version of Winlink Express from winlink.org and run the installer. Follow the instructions to complete the installation.
- Launch Winlink Express and enter your callsign and password. If you do not have a password, leave it blank and one will be assigned to you after your first connection. You can also enter your grid square and recovery email address for your account settings.
- Choose the mode of operation from the drop-down menu on the top left corner of the window. For this article, I will use Telnet Winlink, which allows you to connect to the Winlink Hybrid Network via the internet. This is useful for testing and updating your software, as well as for sending and receiving messages when the internet is available. You can also choose other modes, such as Winmor Winlink, Packet Winlink, or Pactor Winlink, which allow you to connect to the Winlink Hybrid Network via radio. Each mode has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the speed, reliability, and availability of the radio link.
- Open a session by clicking on the Open Session button on the top right corner of the window. This will open a new window where you can see the status and progress of your connection. If you are using Telnet Winlink, you will be connected to a CMS station via the internet. If you are using a radio mode, you will need to select a frequency and a station from the list of available RMS stations, and then tune your radio to that frequency. You can also use the propagation prediction tool to find the best frequency and station for your location and time of day.
- Send and receive messages by clicking on the Post to Outbox button or the Update Inbox button on the main window. You can also compose a new message by clicking on the New Message button, or reply to an existing message by double-clicking on it. You can send and receive messages to and from other callsigns or email addresses, as well as request weather bulletins, position reports, and other services. You can also use various forms, such as ICS, HICS, Red Cross, and more, to facilitate standardized and efficient communication.


## How to use Winlink Express?
To use Winlink Express, you will need to follow these tips:

- Check the Winlink Web Services for the latest information and updates on the Winlink system, such as the status of the CMS and RMS stations, the propagation conditions, the user activity, and the news and announcements. You can access the Winlink Web Services by clicking on the Tools menu and selecting Winlink Web Services, or by visiting winlink.org on your web browser.
- Update your Winlink Express software regularly to ensure that you have the latest features and bug fixes. You can update your software by clicking on the Help menu and selecting Check for Updates, or by downloading and installing the latest version from winlink.org.
- Adjust your interface device and virtual TNC software settings to optimize your radio communication. You will need to set the audio levels, the modulation mode, the baud rate, the frequency correction, and other parameters according to your radio and interface device specifications. You can also use the Test and Tune function of Winlink Express to test your radio connection and adjust your settings accordingly.
- Choose the best mode and frequency for your radio communication, depending on the speed, reliability, and availability of the radio link. You can use the propagation prediction tool of Winlink Express to find the best frequency and station for your location and time of day. You can also use the channel selection tool of Winlink Express to find the best mode and frequency for your message size and priority. You can also manually select the mode and frequency from the list of available RMS stations, or enter a custom frequency and station callsign.
- Organize your messages into personal folders and subfolders, and use filters and rules to sort and manage your messages. You can create, rename, delete, and move folders and subfolders by right-clicking on the folder tree on the left side of the main window. You can also create, edit, delete, and apply filters and rules by clicking on the Tools menu and selecting Message Filters and Rules.

## Conclusion
Winlink Express is a user-friendly and powerful software that allows you to connect to the Winlink Hybrid Network via radio message servers. It enables you to send and receive messages with attachments, position reports, weather bulletins, emergency and relief communications, and more.
