# Introduction to Winlink
Have you ever wondered how you can send and receive emails over radio frequencies, without relying on the internet or cellular networks? If you are a radio amateur, a disaster relief worker, or simply an enthusiast of off-grid communication, you might be interested in learning about Winlink.

## What is Winlink?
Winlink, or formally, Winlink Global Radio Email (registered US Service Mark), also known as the Winlink 2000 Network, is a worldwide radio messaging system that uses amateur-band radio frequencies and government frequencies to provide radio interconnection services that include email with attachments, position reporting, weather bulletins, emergency and relief communications, and message relay1.

Winlink operates through a network of radio stations and volunteers who provide the infrastructure and the software to make this service possible. The network consists of Common Message Servers (CMS) that are connected to the internet, and Radio Message Servers (RMS) that are connected to the CMS via radio or internet links. Users can access the network via RMS stations using various modes and frequencies, depending on their equipment and location.

Winlink is built, operated and administered entirely by licensed “Ham” volunteers. It is supported by the Amateur Radio Safety Foundation, Inc., a US 501 © (3) non-profit, public-benefit entity. Winlink Global Radio Email®️ is a US registered trademark of the Amateur Radio Safety Foundation, Inc.

## How does Winlink work?
Winlink uses a store-and-forward system to exchange messages between users and the internet. When a user wants to send a message, they connect to an RMS station using their radio and client software, such as Winlink Express. The RMS station receives the message and forwards it to a CMS station via radio or internet link. The CMS station then delivers the message to the intended recipient, either via another RMS station or via standard internet email protocols.

When a user wants to receive a message, they connect to an RMS station and request a mailbox check. The RMS station queries the CMS station for any messages addressed to the user, and downloads them via radio or internet link. The RMS station then sends the messages to the user’s radio and client software.

Winlink can operate completely without the internet, using smart-network radio relays. If the internet connection is down or unreliable, the RMS stations can relay messages to each other via radio links until they reach a CMS station or the intended recipient. This way, Winlink can ensure reliable and resilient communication in any situation.

## What are the main features of Winlink?
Winlink offers a number of features that make it a versatile and powerful system for radio email communication. Some of the main features are:

- Email with attachments: Winlink supports email with attachments, such as images, documents, spreadsheets, and more. Users can send and receive attachments up to 120 KB in size, depending on the mode and frequency used. Winlink employs the B2F extension radio transfer protocol, which allows attachments, multiple addresses, and tactical addresses.
- Position reporting: Winlink supports position reporting, which allows users to send and receive their location information, such as latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, course, and more. Users can also view the positions of other Winlink users on a map, using the Winlink Web Services or the client software. Position reporting can be useful for tracking, navigation, and coordination purposes.
- Weather bulletins: Winlink supports weather bulletins, which allow users to send and receive weather information, such as forecasts, warnings, alerts, and more. Users can also request weather bulletins from various sources, such as the National Weather Service, the National Hurricane Center, and the World Meteorological Organization. Weather bulletins can be useful for planning, safety, and situational awareness purposes.
- Emergency and relief communications: Winlink supports emergency and relief communications, which allow users to send and receive messages related to disaster response, humanitarian aid, public safety, and more. Users can also use a variety of forms, such as ICS, HICS, Red Cross, and more, to facilitate standardized and efficient communication. Winlink is well-known for its role in interoperable emergency and disaster relief communications, and has been used in many events, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires, and more.
- Message relay: Winlink supports message relay, which allows users to send and receive messages to and from other radio networks, such as HF, VHF, UHF, APRS, and more. Users can also use peer-to-peer connectivity, which enables direct RF connections to other Winlink Express or Airmail clients, without relying on the Winlink Hybrid Network or the internet. Message relay can be useful for bridging different communication systems and expanding the reach of Winlink.

## Conclusion
Winlink is a remarkable system that provides radio email communication to and from the internet, using amateur-band radio frequencies and government frequencies. It is a network of radio stations and volunteers who provide the infrastructure and the software to make this service possible. It offers a number of features that make it a versatile and powerful system for radio email communication, especially in situations where the internet is not available or reliable. It also supports emergency and relief communications, as well as message relay to other radio networks.
