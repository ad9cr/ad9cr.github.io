# National Traffic System (NTS) and Message Handling
The National Traffic System (NTS) is a vital network that allows for the rapid movement of messages, referred to as “traffic,” from origin to destination. Whether during disasters or routine communication, NTS ensures that critical information reaches its intended recipients. Let’s explore the purpose, structure, and significance of the NTS.

## Purpose of NTS
- Emergency Communication: During disasters or other emergencies, radiograms (written messages) are used to communicate information critical to saving lives or property. Hams play a crucial role in relaying these messages.
- Training and Participation: NTS trains amateur operators to handle written traffic and participate in directed nets. These nets operate at the local, section, region, and area levels, 365 days per year.

## Structure of NTS
1. Voice and CW Traffic Nets:
  - NTS consists of both voice (phone) and CW (Morse code) traffic nets.
  - These nets provide organized channels for passing messages.
  - Amateur radio operators participate in scheduled nets, ensuring efficient message flow.
1. Digital System:
  - NTS also operates a digital system that runs 24/7.
  - Digital modes like PACTOR, Winlink, and VARA enable reliable message handling.
  - Amateur radio operators use computers and specialized software to exchange traffic digitally.
1. Layering and Sequencing:
  - The network layers and sequences traffic, ensuring timely delivery.
  - Messages move from local nets to higher-level nets, eventually reaching their destination.

## Message Handling Process
1. Originating a Message:
  - A sender (originator) drafts a radiogram.
  - The message includes the recipient’s address, text, and any special handling instructions.
1. Local Nets:
  - The sender passes the message to a local net.
  - Net control operators (NCS) manage the flow of traffic.
1. Section and Region Nets:
  - Messages move up through section and region nets.
  - Amateur radio operators relay traffic across larger areas.
1. Area Nets:
  - Area nets cover broader regions.
  - Messages continue their journey toward the destination.
1. Delivery to Recipient:
  - The final net delivers the message to the recipient.
  - Amateur radio operators ensure accurate and timely delivery.

## Significance of NTS
- Resilience: NTS provides an alternative to commercial communication systems.
- Public Service: amateur radio operators serve their communities by handling health and welfare messages, emergency requests, and more.
- Training Ground: NTS hones operators’ skills in message handling, net operation, and protocol adherence.

Remember, when you hear the rhythmic sound of Morse code or the voices on an NTS net, you’re witnessing a vital service that connects people across the continent within 24 hours.
