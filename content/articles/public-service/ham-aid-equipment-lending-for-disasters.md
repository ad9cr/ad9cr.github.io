# Ham Aid: Equipment Lending for Disasters
In times of disaster, when on-site communication equipment is damaged or compromised, the ARRL Ham Aid Program steps in to provide crucial support. Let’s explore the program’s guidelines, purpose, and how it ensures that amateur radio operators (hams) can continue their vital communication role during emergencies.

## Background and Creation
- Hurricane Katrina: The Ham Aid program emerged in response to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
- Amateur Radio Manufacturers’ Donations: Many manufacturers donated equipment to ARRL (American Radio Relay League) to create an inventory for Ham Aid.
- ARRL as Custodian: ARRL agreed to serve as the custodian of this equipment, ensuring its availability for disaster response within the United States.

## Program Guidelines
1. Purpose and Permissible Use of Ham Aid Equipment:
  - Ham Aid provides Amateur Radio equipment for loan to amateur radio operators during disasters.
  - The intent is to assist groups on-site, serving communities and residents during emergencies.
Requests must be made by the ARRL Section Manager or designee, approved by an ARRL officer.
