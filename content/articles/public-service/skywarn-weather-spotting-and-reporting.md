# SKYWARN™: Weather Spotting and Reporting
The SKYWARN™ program is a nationwide network of volunteers trained by the National Weather Service (NWS) to provide timely and accurate severe weather reports. These dedicated spotters play a crucial role in keeping our communities safe during hazardous weather events. Let’s delve into how SKYWARN™ works and the impact it has on early warning systems.

## How SKYWARN™ Works
1. Volunteer Spotters:
  - SKYWARN™ relies on trained volunteers who observe and report weather conditions from their local areas.
  - These spotters act as the NWS’s eyes and ears, providing critical information that enhances weather forecasts and warnings.
1. Reporting Channels:
  - Spotters use various communication methods to relay their observations:
    - Phone or Internet: Reports arrive at NWS offices via volunteers with access to phones or the internet.
    - Citizen Band (CB) Radio: CB operators contribute real-time weather data.
    - Amateur Radio Operators: Licensed amateur radio operators play a significant role in SKYWARN™ by reporting severe weather events.
1. What Spotters Report:
  - Spotters focus on identifying and evaluating severe weather features:
    - Thunderstorms: Lightning, hail, strong winds, and tornadoes.
    - Flooding: Rapidly rising water levels, blocked roads, and inundated areas.
    - Winter Weather: Snow accumulation, freezing rain, and icy conditions.
    - Other Hazards: Such as dense fog, dust storms, or wildfires.

## Real-Life Impact
1. Tornado Warnings:
  - Spotters provide ground truth during tornado outbreaks. Their reports confirm tornado touchdowns, funnel clouds, and damage paths.
  - This information helps NWS issue timely warnings, giving residents precious minutes to seek shelter.
1. Flash Flood Alerts:
  - When heavy rainfall leads to flash floods, spotters report rising water levels, flooded roads, and affected neighborhoods.
  - NWS uses this data to issue flood watches and warnings, preventing loss of life and property damage.
1. Severe Thunderstorm Verification:
  - Spotters verify severe thunderstorms by reporting hail size, wind gusts, and storm intensity.
  - This validation improves the accuracy of warnings and ensures public safety.

## How Can You Get Involved?
1. Attend Training:
  - NWS offers free SKYWARN™ training sessions that typically last about 2 hours.
  - Learn the basics of thunderstorm development, storm structure, and how to identify severe weather features.
1. Become a Spotter:
  - Anyone interested in public service can join SKYWARN™. Police, fire personnel, EMS workers, utility workers, and concerned citizens are encouraged to participate.
  - Find a class in your area and get started!
1. Stay Informed:
  - Keep an eye on local weather updates and alerts.
  - When severe weather strikes, be ready to report your observations to the NWS.

Remember, your contribution as a SKYWARN™ spotter can save lives and protect communities. Let’s work together to enhance our weather resilience!
