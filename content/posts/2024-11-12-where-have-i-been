# Where have I been

It's been a long time since my last post! This year I took on a major project of converting our unfinished basement to a workshop and ham shack to support various hobbies. It's one of those things that will probably never be "done", but at least is now "done enough". I have space dedicated to support:

* 3D Printing
* Electronics
* Sublimation
* Vinyl cutting
* CNC operation
* Amateur radio operation

I am a novice at best in most of these areas and am really looking forward to using the space to learn. As the weather turns colder, I'm going to try to be much better about blogging and may even do a series following my learnings in these areas.
