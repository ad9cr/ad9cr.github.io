# Hello World, and welcome to my new blog

My name is Kyle Burns and this is my new blog. I am starting the blog both to reinforce my own learning (because I find that writing about what I learn helps it stick) and to help others who may be on similar learning journeys to mine. While I don't plan to be strict with myself about staying "on topic", I do intend to focus primarily on topics related to amateur radio in general, portable operation, and the use of amateur radio to help serve the public interest. That's all for this post, but I look forward to sharing here often.
